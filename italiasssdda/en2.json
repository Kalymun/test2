      "ONE":"So, what exactly is mastering?",
      "TWO":"How can I prepare my mix to get the best results from mastering?",
      "THREE":"Can a robot really mix or master my tracks?",
      "FOUR":"I don't like the idea of my track being over compressed and slammed through a limiter to sound loud at all costs. Is that what LANDR does?",
      "FIVE":"Does it only master songs?",
      "SIX":"Should I use LANDR, or hire a mastering studio?"
    },
    "ANSWERS":{
      "ONE":"<p>Mastering is the art of refining and polishing finished stereo mixes by making subtle  adjustments to equalization, selectively adding compression, limiting, stereo enhancement, and other psychoacoustic tricks like aural excitation. Are you excited yet?<\/p>",
      "TWO":"<p>LANDR is designed to be nearly foolproof, but, like any mastering service, or relationship, benefits from a little bit of breathing room.<\/p><p>First of all, make sure the master output isn't clipping. In fact, you should leave several dbs of headroom (keep the bouncing master level meters well below the red), ideally at -4 or -5db.<\/p><p>Secondly, avoid compression, limiting or EQ on the master output of your final mix. Only apply these processes if you feel they are musically essential, and try a version where they are left out completely.<\/p><p>Finally, export your mix in the highest possible bit depth (ex: 24bit) and sample rate (ex: 48kHz). This shouldn&rsquo;t make a huge difference over 16bit \/ 44.1kHz, but the more resolution LANDR has to read from, the more precisely it will make its adjustments.<\/p>",
      "THREE":"<p>LANDR is a tool designed by sound engineers so, although it employs artificial intelligence, it is guided by profoundly human thought. The MixGenius team is comprised of leading sound engineers, signal processing specialists, record label owners, musicians and even an astrophysicist, all pursuing excellence in sound using cutting edge technology.<\/p>",
      "FOUR":"<p>Not at all. We've worked hard to avoid this kind of simplistic mastering and have created a highly responsive, sensitive and incredibly musical mastering engine. If you think that our masters still sound too loud, try adjusting the settings. Keep in mind that we’ve tuned the output based on real human testing, so LANDR is designed to give users what they want… and it’s listening and learning to all the feedback we throw at it, so it’s only going to get better.<\/p>",
      "FIVE":"<p>Nope, in fact we encourage people to try different things on it. Master samples for production work, drop in a drum bus, process a vocal on its own, or even put a full DJ set or live performance in. Get creative with LANDR and let us know how it sounds!<\/p>",
      "SIX":"<p>The polish and balance achieved through the subtle adjustments of a skilled mastering engineer is not something we would ever diminish. There are some very talented engineers out there with exceptional ears, capable of brilliant work. It’s a beautiful art form, but there’s also a lot of science behind it, as our resident astrophysicist can attest.  What we've designed is a tool that’s so easy and affordable to use, it just makes sense to try LANDR out first. If you’re unsure of the results, and can afford to invest more time, effort and money, then pro mastering may well be worth your while. Having a LANDR file as a reference can be a useful tool, along with your feedback it will guide a mastering engineer in the right direction.<\/p>"

      "CONTENT":"<p>The music world has changed. New technology has made it easy and affordable for artists to create and share their work with total independence, but the final step in making music a fully DIY enterprise - mastering - has remained&nbsp;a complicated and elusive step. Until now.&nbsp;<\/p><p><span class='mg-blue'>Better Sound. Instantly.<\/span><\/p><p>LANDR revolutionizes the mastering process with drag-and-drop simplicity, achieving&nbsp;results that rival professional studio work in minutes. This opens up a world of possibilities for producers: LANDR your demos before sharing them, drop in full length DJ mixes or live recordings, make a track on the road and have it mastered in time for your gig the same night. LANDR lets you integrate mastering seamlessly into your creative process.&nbsp;<\/p><p><span class='mg-blue'>A.I. From the Heart<\/span><\/p><p>MixGenius incubated and refined algorithms developed over eight years of university research, testing and tweaking based on feedback from trained audio experts. Our team is composed of music industry veterans -&nbsp;award winning mixing engineers, top-level DSP programmers, musicians, producers and label owners - who know exactly what the mastering process needs to deliver.<\/p><p>LANDR is smart and getting smarter. Its true beauty lies in its ability to learn. Our system is built around an adaptive engine that &lsquo;listens&rsquo; and reacts to music, using micro-genre detection to make subtle frame-by-frame adjustments selectively using tools like multi-band compression, EQ, stereo enhancement, limiting and aural excitation based on the unique properties of the song. Basically, the more we throw at LANDR, the better it gets.<\/p><p><span class='mg-blue'>The Simple Truth<\/span><\/p><p>Rather than present an overwhelming array of options, LANDR presents one. Great design is all about limiting the field. We've added just a couple of carefully selected options to guide LANDR to produce the perfect master for you. If you feel comfortable in front of 40 different knobs, then try out one of the many quality mastering plugins out there, then compare the results to what LANDR can do.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re confident you&rsquo;ll hear the difference.<\/p>"
